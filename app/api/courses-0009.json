The course will focus on how individuals pursue unique forms of expression, act upon their distinct experiences, and follow their own desires, creating enduring works that we continue to look to for inspiration and wisdom. </p>\n<p>You will discuss the theories of early Chinese thinkers like Confucius and Zhuangzi, explore the poetry of writers like Tao Yuanming and Du Fu, read from novels such as the Dream of the Red Chamber, and learn how to see painting and calligraphy – all with a particular focus on how these works have shaped Chinese culture as we know it today.</p>",

You don’t need to know any special musical terminology or theory to begin; You will learn all the concepts you need as we go… and the terminology and how it varies across the world. The course will explore music from all over the world and throughout time, from traditional African music, to Balinese Gamelan, to classical Japanese, Indian, and Western music, to contemporary reggaetone and punk music. You will learn how to recognize specific kinds of rhythms, and follow their development through time and around the world. You will also learn how different cultures developed different styles and ideas about rhythm, meter, melody and structure, and learn to start to distinguish some main ideas. So whether you’re a virtuoso violinist or tabla player, or your main musical expertise is singing in the shower, all you need to succeed in this course is curiosity and a willingness to jump in with both feet.</p>",

The course will explore music from all over the world and throughout time, from traditional African music, to Balinese Gamelan, to classical Japanese, Indian, and Western music, to contemporary reggaetone and punk music. You will learn how to recognize specific kinds of rhythms, and follow their development through time and around the world. You will also learn how different cultures developed different styles and ideas about rhythm, meter, melody and structure, and learn to start to distinguish some main ideas. So whether you’re a virtuoso violinist or tabla player, or your main musical expertise is singing in the shower, all you need to succeed in this course is curiosity and a willingness to jump in with both feet.</p>",

In this way intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development are closely linked. The international community made a commitment to safeguarding living heritage when it adopted the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000132540\">Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> in 2003 and it set itself ambitious goals by adopting the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. This course helps to understand the connections between the two.</p>\n<p>By taking this course students and other interested learners and professionals will gain a better understanding of intangible cultural heritage and its relationships with sustainable development, exploring examples and experiences of communities from around the world.</p>\n<p>By joining the course learners are invited to rethink development from a culture perspective!</p>\n<p><strong>This course is for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anyone new to the concept of intangible cultural heritage</strong> who wants to understand what intangible cultural heritage is, why it is important to people’s wellbeing and what role it plays in the lives of people, including young people;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Graduate students and advanced undergraduate students</strong> interested in the key concepts and practices of sustainability and global issues;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key actors engaged in the field of sustainable development at a local, regional or international level</strong> , including those who work in corporate sustainability and responsibility and who want to understand the relationship between intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practitioners and professionals engaged in living heritage safeguarding</strong> , who want to refresh their knowledge on the key concepts of safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage and want to learn more about the relationship between living heritage and sustainable development.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

How is it relevant for addressing today’s development challenges in areas such as health, education, gender, natural disasters and conflict? Why is it important to keep this heritage alive? Communities around the world are transmitting their living heritage, which gives meaning to their lives, strengthens resilience, and contributes to their well-being. In this way intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development are closely linked. The international community made a commitment to safeguarding living heritage when it adopted the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000132540\">Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> in 2003 and it set itself ambitious goals by adopting the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. This course helps to understand the connections between the two.</p>\n<p>By taking this course students and other interested learners and professionals will gain a better understanding of intangible cultural heritage and its relationships with sustainable development, exploring examples and experiences of communities from around the world.</p>\n<p>By joining the course learners are invited to rethink development from a culture perspective!</p>\n<p><strong>This course is for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anyone new to the concept of intangible cultural heritage</strong> who wants to understand what intangible cultural heritage is, why it is important to people’s wellbeing and what role it plays in the lives of people, including young people;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Graduate students and advanced undergraduate students</strong> interested in the key concepts and practices of sustainability and global issues;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key actors engaged in the field of sustainable development at a local, regional or international level</strong> , including those who work in corporate sustainability and responsibility and who want to understand the relationship between intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practitioners and professionals engaged in living heritage safeguarding</strong> , who want to refresh their knowledge on the key concepts of safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage and want to learn more about the relationship between living heritage and sustainable development.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Join us and expand your perspective on what is possible with space, words, and live performance.</p>\n<p>Learning to pace a story effectively, to engage and surprise an audience(and to make them laugh!), are useful skills for your professional development outside the Arts.</p>\n<p>Skill transferability, flexible thinking, and expert language abilities are now essential in a diversifying global job market - come and learn essential new skills, and have fun doing it!</p>\n<p>You will be set writing exercises over the course of the module, and you will asked to keep a brief creativity journal to note how your ideas progress and how your intuition leads you into productivity. By the end of this module, you will have completed a plan for the structure of a new play. You will have tried out different ways of writing dialogue and found one that suits you – you will be invited to share this in a discussion forum with your peers.</p>",
