    "tertiary_description": "<p>How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?</p>\n<p>Remote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.</p>\n<p>Remote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.</p>\n<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.</p>\n<p>Remote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— <em>The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere</em>. Praise for the book includes:</p>\n<p><em>\"Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives. Few of us are going back to the way we worked. Read her book and begin to prepare for the other side of this pandemic now.\" - Larry Culp, CEO of GE</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I often talk about the importance of trust when it comes to work: the trust of your employees, and building trust with your customers. This book provides a blueprint for how to build and maintain that trust and connection in a digital environment.\" - Eric S. Yuan, Founder &amp; CEO, Zoom</em></p>",

        "value": "<p>How are you thriving or surviving in your remote work environment?</p>\n<p>Remote working has long been an option for many organizations and employees. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more organizations were forced to rapidly shift to remote work. While there are many benefits of remote working, including reduced commute, greater employee flexibility, increased productivity, lower operational costs, and a larger pool of global job applicants, virtual work can introduce new challenges. Employees and companies alike have learned to temporarily survive in a remote work environment; but, remote work is here to stay and will likely be a permanent fixture that transforms many organizations in one form or another. Everyone will need to develop the skills, competencies, tools, and mindsets to thrive in the remote environment.</p>\n<p>Remote work affects an entire organization. For individual contributors, it means having to learn to collaborate effectively with colleagues you rarely see in person. For managers, it means knowing how to lead fully remote teams, developing ways to keep your teams motivated, connected, and productive. For leaders, shifting to remote-work solutions means rapidly advancing your digital footprint, using cloud storage, considering cybersecurity risks, and deploying new tools to increase productivity among your workforce.</p>\n<p>In Remote Work Revolution for Everyone, you will learn to excel in the virtual-work landscape. Using the Harvard Business School case method of real-world examples, Professor Tsedal Neeley will not only provide actionable recommendations but also explain the theories and concepts behind them. You will learn how to build trust, increase productivity, use digital tools intelligently, and remain fully aligned with your remote team. By the end of the course, you will create actionable steps to “relaunch” your team—focusing on new ways to stay connected, be collaborative, and remain productive—while meeting your own personal and organizational goals.</p>\n<p>Remote Work Revolution for Everyone will teach you best practices for working remotely. This course is based on Professor Neeley’s book— <em>The Remote Work Revolution: Succeeding from Anywhere</em>. Praise for the book includes:</p>\n<p><em>\"Neeley draws on her nearly 2 decades of research to answer the critical questions regarding how we best build productive and enjoyable virtual routines into our post-COVID-19 professional lives. Few of us are going back to the way we worked. Read her book and begin to prepare for the other side of this pandemic now.\" - Larry Culp, CEO of GE</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I often talk about the importance of trust when it comes to work: the trust of your employees, and building trust with your customers. This book provides a blueprint for how to build and maintain that trust and connection in a digital environment.\" - Eric S. Yuan, Founder &amp; CEO, Zoom</em></p>",

You begin the process of telling a story about your data by creating several basic and advanced charts in Excel and learning how to add them to a digital dashboard. You then become familiar with IBM Cognos Analytics - a popular tool for data visualization and analytics – and learn how to use it to create interactive and informative dashboards. By completing this course, you will gain a basic understanding of using spreadsheets as a tool for data visualization. You will also gain the ability to create effective data visualizations, such as charts or graphs, and you will start to see how they can play a key role in the communication of your data analysis findings to interested parties. All of this can be accomplished without the need to write any code. By the end of this course you will be able to describe common dashboarding tools used by a data analyst, design and create a dashboard in a cloud platform, and begin to raise your level of confidence when creating intermediate level data visualizations.</p>\n<p>The emphasis is on applied learning and hands-on practice in this course, and with each hands-on lab, you will gain further experience in the creation of basic and advanced charts and the creation of digital dashboards using both Excel and Cognos Analytics. The final assignment project will allow you to apply these newly acquired skills to create and use data visualizations and add them to a digital dashboard to fulfil a business scenario.</p>\n<p>This course makes it simple to get started using Excel and Cognos Analytics to create data<br />\nvisualizations and dashboards to help tell a story about your data, and it does not require any previous data analysis or computer science</p>\n<p>experience. The course also does not require you to perform any software downloads or installations. All that is required is basic computer literacy, high-school level math, a device with a modern web browser, and the ability to use (or create) a Microsoft account to access Excel online at no-cost, and a basic understanding of Excel spreadsheets. Although the Excel hands-on labs steps are specifically related to using ‘Excel for the web’, if you already have the full desktop version of Excel, you should be able to use that to follow along quite easily with the labs.</p>",

Enroll to learn more, complete the course and claim your badge!</em></p>\n<p>This course provides students with the basics required to create data visualizations and dashboards using both Microsoft Excel and IBM Cognos Analytics. You begin the process of telling a story about your data by creating several basic and advanced charts in Excel and learning how to add them to a digital dashboard. You then become familiar with IBM Cognos Analytics - a popular tool for data visualization and analytics – and learn how to use it to create interactive and informative dashboards. By completing this course, you will gain a basic understanding of using spreadsheets as a tool for data visualization. You will also gain the ability to create effective data visualizations, such as charts or graphs, and you will start to see how they can play a key role in the communication of your data analysis findings to interested parties. All of this can be accomplished without the need to write any code. By the end of this course you will be able to describe common dashboarding tools used by a data analyst, design and create a dashboard in a cloud platform, and begin to raise your level of confidence when creating intermediate level data visualizations.</p>\n<p>The emphasis is on applied learning and hands-on practice in this course, and with each hands-on lab, you will gain further experience in the creation of basic and advanced charts and the creation of digital dashboards using both Excel and Cognos Analytics. The final assignment project will allow you to apply these newly acquired skills to create and use data visualizations and add them to a digital dashboard to fulfil a business scenario.</p>\n<p>This course makes it simple to get started using Excel and Cognos Analytics to create data<br />\nvisualizations and dashboards to help tell a story about your data, and it does not require any previous data analysis or computer science</p>\n<p>experience. The course also does not require you to perform any software downloads or installations. All that is required is basic computer literacy, high-school level math, a device with a modern web browser, and the ability to use (or create) a Microsoft account to access Excel online at no-cost, and a basic understanding of Excel spreadsheets. Although the Excel hands-on labs steps are specifically related to using ‘Excel for the web’, if you already have the full desktop version of Excel, you should be able to use that to follow along quite easily with the labs.</p>",

You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!</p>",

This course will take you through nine of the greatest unsolved problems of modern astrophysics. We can't promise you the answers, but we will explain what we do and don't know, and give you an up-to-date understanding of current research. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. </p>\n<p>This is the first of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program.

Geared towards professionals working in financial markets, this course provides a solid introduction to the financial risks and opportunities arising from man-made climate change. </p>\n<p>Our aim is to help you answer a simple question: Does climate risk matter to investors? We do this by defining the financial risks related to climate change and follow with the investment policies and risk management strategies that are taking shape. This course is also a starting point for risk and strategy managers anticipating the impacts from the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) asking firms to disclose the climate risks they face. In short, the course is a primer on how global capital markets are responding the world’s greatest environmental risk. </p>\n<p>Participants will be exposed to the latest thinking from senior leaders in financial services and multinational firms. The course is led by business school faculty and The Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College London; designed by investment practitioners for finance professionals and those aspiring to enter the field. </p>\n<p>Climate-KIC is supported by EIT, a body of the European Union.</p>",

Fundamental disagreements on critical policy, economic, and political issues make it essential to learn how to compose an effectiveargument and to analyze the arguments of others. This ability will help you engage in civil discourse and make needed changes in society. Conveying a convincing message can benefit your personal, public, and professional lives.</p>\n<p>This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of rhetoric, the art of persuasive writing and speech. In it, you will learn to construct and defend compelling arguments, a crucial skill in many settings. We will be using selected speeches from prominent twentieth-century Americans -- including Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, Margaret Chase Smith, Ronald Reagan, and more -- to explore and analyze rhetorical structure and style. Through this analysis, you will learn how speakers and writers persuade an audience to adopt their point of view.</p>\n<p>Built around Harvard Professor James Engell's on-campus course, \"Elements of Rhetoric,\" this course will help you analyze and apply rhetorical structure and style, appreciate the relevance of persuasive communication in your own life, and understand how to persuade and recognize when someone is trying to persuade you. You will be inspired to share your viewpoint and discover the most powerful ways to convince others to champion your cause. Join us to find your voice!</p>",

Data scientists use a range of programming languages, such as Python and R, to harness and analyze data. This course focuses on using Python in data science. By the end of the course, you’ll have a fundamental understanding of machine learning models and basic concepts around Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>\n<p>Using Python, learners will study regression models (Linear, Multilinear, and Polynomial) and classification models (kNN, Logistic), utilizing popular libraries such as sklearn, Pandas, matplotlib, and numPy. The course will cover key concepts of machine learning such as: picking the right complexity, preventing overfitting, regularization, assessing uncertainty, weighing trade-offs, and model evaluation. Participation in this course will build your confidence in using Python, preparing you for more advanced study in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and advancement in your career.</p>\n<p>Learners must have a minimum baseline of programming knowledge (preferably in Python) and statistics in order to be successful in this course.

We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding and ability to implement basic data analyses. We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of conducting reproducible research.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the course materials into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. We start with simple calculations and descriptive statistics. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",

We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding and ability to implement basic data analyses. We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of conducting reproducible research.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the course materials into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. We start with simple calculations and descriptive statistics. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",

It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>\n<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>\n<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>\n<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",

        "value": "<p><strong>About the Database Series of Courses</strong></p>\n<p>\"Databases\" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>\n<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>\n<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>\n<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",

The motivation for this course is the circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of some securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability. </p>\n<p>We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance. </p>\n<p>Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists.</p>",

The motivation for this course is the circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of some securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability. </p>\n<p>We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance. </p>\n<p>Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists.</p>",

We learn why some programs succeed where others do less well and what strategies are key for enabling widespread adaptation of quality programming. For those working around the world in early childhood development programs, this course allows you to reflect and evaluate your own organization by reviewing real-world case successes, as well as a new global perspective from other learners.

The philosophical concepts discussed provide tools to change your life and increase personal happiness by focusing on your actions, the power of ritual, and the importance of sensing the world around you. </p>\n<p>Through a series of lectures, animations, discussions, and reflection diaries, this course focuses on close readings from prominent Chinese philosophers. The course requires no prior knowledge of Chinese philosophy or history and all texts are in translation. </p>\n<p>Adapted from one of the most popular classes at Harvard, this course is now available online for the first time. Learn from award-winning professor Michael Puett and start on your path towards happiness.</p>",

It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>\n<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>\n<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>\n<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",

        "value": "<p><strong>About the Database Series of Courses</strong></p>\n<p>\"Databases\" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>\n<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>\n<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>\n<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",

Companies that were non-existent a few short years ago, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber, have dramatically changed how we interact, communicate and navigate our world. Even Amazon and Google are relatively “young” by any measure. If you’re an entrepreneur, investor, manager, or student, you need thoughtful approaches to navigate and win in this new, evolving environment.</p>\n<p>This online course is organized around four broad themes and leverages relevant theory and analysis, as well as numerous practical examples to develop key learning points and accelerate your knowledge of digital marketing.</p>\n<p>The themes are:</p>\n<p>● Behavioral foundations for understanding and navigating the new online-offline landscape</p>\n<p>● New forms of interaction, including formation of networks and reputation building</p>\n<p>● Tools and principles of digital marketing action including online advertising on fixed and mobile devices</p>\n<p>● New media platforms and emergence of various marketing channels and mixed marketing models</p>\n<p>This course is beneficial to marketing professionals, analysts, entrepreneurs, small business owners, investors, and consumers.</p>\n<p>This course is part of Maryland Smith’s Digital Marketing Professional Certificate.

Companies that were non-existent a few short years ago, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber, have dramatically changed how we interact, communicate and navigate our world. Even Amazon and Google are relatively “young” by any measure. If you’re an entrepreneur, investor, manager, or student, you need thoughtful approaches to navigate and win in this new, evolving environment.</p>\n<p>This online course is organized around four broad themes and leverages relevant theory and analysis, as well as numerous practical examples to develop key learning points and accelerate your knowledge of digital marketing.</p>\n<p>The themes are:</p>\n<p>● Behavioral foundations for understanding and navigating the new online-offline landscape</p>\n<p>● New forms of interaction, including formation of networks and reputation building</p>\n<p>● Tools and principles of digital marketing action including online advertising on fixed and mobile devices</p>\n<p>● New media platforms and emergence of various marketing channels and mixed marketing models</p>\n<p>This course is beneficial to marketing professionals, analysts, entrepreneurs, small business owners, investors, and consumers.</p>\n<p>This course is part of Maryland Smith’s Digital Marketing Professional Certificate.

In this course, you will learn the how and why of biology by exploring the function of the molecular components of cells, and how these cellular components are organized in a complex hierarchy.</p>\n<p>This course is designed to explore the fundamentals of cell biology. The overarching goal is for learners to understand, from a human-centered perspective, that cells are evolving ensembles of macromolecules that in turn form complex communities in tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms.</p>\n<p>We will focus, in particular, on the mitochondrion, the organelle that powers the cell. In this context, we will look at the processes of cell metabolism. Finally, we will examine the F1F0 ATP synthase, the molecular machine that is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP that your cells require to do work. To underscore the importance of cell biology to our lives, we will address questions of development and disease and implications of science in society.</p>\n<p>By the end of four weeks, we hope learners will have a deep intuition for the functional logic of a cell.

The well-designed, semi-genuine video conversations, practice worksheets, and hands-on exercises accommodate your different learning levels and styles. This design objective is to cover the four communicative skills required to learn a foreign language—reading, writing, listening, and speaking. </span></p>\n<p>You will also learn numerous words and become familiar with the a-b-c’s of Arab culture, as well as the best ways to approach Arabic speakers. You will be introduced to some types of non-verbal communication that are popular in the Arab region, which you are expected to know.</p>\n<p>Since this course is a doorway to the Arabic language, we will teach you the shapes and sounds of the Arabic letters as well. Arabic is a member of the Semitic language family. This means that the directionality of Arabic script is right to left, in addition to a number of other characteristics that you will discover during your learning journey in this course.</p>\n<p>Several professionals including linguists, educators, and e-learning platform developers collaborated to put this course together. The goal is to apply the best scientific and pedagogical methods proven to help non-Arabic speakers learn Arabic.</p>\n<p>This course will undoubtedly be an enjoyable journey if you have a passion for knowledge and exotic adventures in the Arab world with all its diverse cultures.</p>",

This design objective is to cover the four communicative skills required to learn a foreign language—reading, writing, listening, and speaking. </span></p>\n<p>You will also learn numerous words and become familiar with the a-b-c’s of Arab culture, as well as the best ways to approach Arabic speakers. You will be introduced to some types of non-verbal communication that are popular in the Arab region, which you are expected to know.</p>\n<p>Since this course is a doorway to the Arabic language, we will teach you the shapes and sounds of the Arabic letters as well. Arabic is a member of the Semitic language family. This means that the directionality of Arabic script is right to left, in addition to a number of other characteristics that you will discover during your learning journey in this course.</p>\n<p>Several professionals including linguists, educators, and e-learning platform developers collaborated to put this course together. The goal is to apply the best scientific and pedagogical methods proven to help non-Arabic speakers learn Arabic.</p>\n<p>This course will undoubtedly be an enjoyable journey if you have a passion for knowledge and exotic adventures in the Arab world with all its diverse cultures.</p>",

This course, part ofour<a href=\"https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science\">Professional Certificate Program in Data Science</a>, covers how to implement linear regression and adjust for confounding in practice using R. </p>\n<p>In data science applications, it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables. The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs by using linear regression. </p>\n<p>We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process. It is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use, and this course will teach you when to apply this technique.</p>",

The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs by using linear regression. </p>\n<p>We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process. It is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use, and this course will teach you when to apply this technique.</p>",

Pre-university Calculus will prepare you for the Introductory Calculus courses by reviewing five important mathematical subjects that are assumed to be mastered by beginning Bachelor students: functions, equations, differentiation, integration and analytic geometry. After this course you will be well prepared to start your university calculus course. You will learn to understand the necessary definitions and mathematical concepts needed and you will be trained to apply those and solve mathematical problems. You will feel confident in using basic mathematical techniques for your first calculus course at university-level, building on high-school level mathematics. We aim to teach you the skills, but also to show you how mathematics will be used in different engineering and science disciplines.</p>\n<p><em>Education method</em></p>\n<p>This is a self-paced course consisting of 7 modules (or weeks) and 1 final exam. The modules consist of a collection of 3-5 minute lecture videos, inspirational videos on the use of mathematics in Science, Engineering and Technology, (interactive) exercises and homework.</p>\n<p>The videos, practice exercises and homework are available free of charge in the audit track. In the ID-verified track, necessary if you pursue a certificate, you can additionally access the final exam.</p>\n<p>This course has been awarded with the 2016 Open Education Award for Excellence in the category 'Open MOOC' by the Open Education Consortium.</p>",

    "tertiary_description": "<p>One of the key insights from the science of happiness is that our own personal happiness depends heavily on our relationships with others. By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.</p>\n<p>This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.</p>\n<p>Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.</p>\n<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide. Here they take a central insight from that course—that our personal well-being is entwined with our social connections—and explain how to apply it to the modern workplace to create more productive, satisfying experiences at work.</p>",

By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.</p>\n<p>This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.</p>\n<p>Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.</p>\n<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide. Here they take a central insight from that course—that our personal well-being is entwined with our social connections—and explain how to apply it to the modern workplace to create more productive, satisfying experiences at work.</p>",

No one wants to do research that can’t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any data intensive research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists. </p>\n<p>To meet the needs of the scientific community, this course will examine the fundamentals of methods and tools for reproducible research. Led by experienced faculty from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, you will participate in six modules that will include several case studies that illustrate the significant impact of reproducible research methods on scientific discovery. </p>\n<p>This course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project. </p>\n<p>We’ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing. </p>\n<p>Consider this course a survey of best practices: we’d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it’ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues. We look forward to seeing you in this course and the research you do in the future!</p>",

No one wants to do research that can’t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any data intensive research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists. </p>\n<p>To meet the needs of the scientific community, this course will examine the fundamentals of methods and tools for reproducible research. Led by experienced faculty from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, you will participate in six modules that will include several case studies that illustrate the significant impact of reproducible research methods on scientific discovery. </p>\n<p>This course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project. </p>\n<p>We’ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing. </p>\n<p>Consider this course a survey of best practices: we’d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it’ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues. We look forward to seeing you in this course and the research you do in the future!</p>",

Rarely are all these wrangling steps necessary in a single analysis, but a data scientist will likely face them all at some point. </p>\n<p>Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling. </p>\n<p>This process is a critical step for any data scientist.

Rarely are all these wrangling steps necessary in a single analysis, but a data scientist will likely face them all at some point. </p>\n<p>Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling. </p>\n<p>This process is a critical step for any data scientist.

In this way intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development are closely linked.

How is it relevant for addressing today’s development challenges in areas such as health, education, gender, natural disasters and conflict? Why is it important to keep this heritage alive? Communities around the world are transmitting their living heritage, which gives meaning to their lives, strengthens resilience, and contributes to their well-being. In this way intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development are closely linked. The international community made a commitment to safeguarding living heritage when it adopted the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000132540\">Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> in 2003 and it set itself ambitious goals by adopting the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. This course helps to understand the connections between the two.</p>\n<p>By taking this course students and other interested learners and professionals will gain a better understanding of intangible cultural heritage and its relationships with sustainable development, exploring examples and experiences of communities from around the world.</p>\n<p>By joining the course learners are invited to rethink development from a culture perspective!</p>\n<p><strong>This course is for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anyone new to the concept of intangible cultural heritage</strong> who wants to understand what intangible cultural heritage is, why it is important to people’s wellbeing and what role it plays in the lives of people, including young people;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Graduate students and advanced undergraduate students</strong> interested in the key concepts and practices of sustainability and global issues;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key actors engaged in the field of sustainable development at a local, regional or international level</strong> , including those who work in corporate sustainability and responsibility and who want to understand the relationship between intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practitioners and professionals engaged in living heritage safeguarding</strong> , who want to refresh their knowledge on the key concepts of safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage and want to learn more about the relationship between living heritage and sustainable development.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

According to Stravinsky, <em>The Rite of Spring</em> was intended to portray “the surge of spring, the magnificent upsurge of nature reborn.” As you will see, Stravinsky’s description is almost frighteningly apt!</p>\n<p>Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through <em>The Rite of Spring</em> , highlighting not only the contributions of Stravinsky, the composer, but also those of his collaborators. Professor Kelly takes learners through the ballet’s development, rehearsals, and finally, premiere performance, and he explores just how and why <em>The Rite of Spring</em> challenged (and to a certain extent, continues to challenge) its listeners.</p>\n<p>You will learn about the ballet’s innovative choreography, the basics of 20th-century orchestral form and technique, and the circumstances of this ballet’s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.</p>",
