But not many of those ideas are based on science. That's where this course comes in.</p>\n<p>\"The Science of Happiness\" is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself--the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.</p>\n<p>What's more, \"The Science of Happiness\" offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.</p>\n<p>The course's co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They'll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude--experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.</p>\n<p>Consider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track. Join the conversation on The Greater Good Science Center Facebook page, or in the BerkeleyX: GG101x The Science of Happiness Facebook group.</p>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: This course is a self-paced course on edX</strong>.</em></p>",

But not many of those ideas are based on science. That's where this course comes in.</p>\n<p>\"The Science of Happiness\" is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself--the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.</p>\n<p>What's more, \"The Science of Happiness\" offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.</p>\n<p>The course's co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They'll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude--experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.</p>\n<p>Consider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track. Join the conversation on The Greater Good Science Center Facebook page, or in the BerkeleyX: GG101x The Science of Happiness Facebook group.</p>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: This course is a self-paced course on edX</strong>.</em></p>",

This course is targeted at those people who have ambitions in Data Analytics or Data Scientist roles, as well as those who just have a need to use Excel to perform data analysis in their own company or environment.</p>\n<p>Learners will gain useful experience in the cleaning and wrangling of data using functions, and in analyzing data using methods such as sorting, filtering, and pivot tables. This course starts with an introduction to spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets and discusses importing data from multiple different formats. During this introduction you will learn to carry out some basic-level data wrangling and data cleaning tasks and then you will expand your knowledge of data analysis via the use of sorting, filtering, and pivot tables in a spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>The emphasis is on applied learning and hands-on practice in this course, and with each hands-on lab, you will gain further experience in the manipulation and handling of data and start to understand the important role that spreadsheets can perform in a data analysis environment. The final assignment project will allow you to apply these newly acquired skills to analyze data in a business scenario. By the end of this course, you will have worked with several data sets and spreadsheets and demonstrated the basics of cleaning and analyzing data all without having to learn any code.</p>\n<p>This course makes it simple to get started using Excel for data analysis, as it does not require any previous spreadsheet or code-writing experience. The course also does not require you to perform any software downloads or installations. All that is required is a device with a modern web browser, and the ability to use (or create) a Microsoft account to access Excel online at no-cost. Although the hands-on labs steps are specifically related to using ‘Excel for the web’, if you already have the full desktop version of Excel, you should be able to use that to follow along quite easily with the labs.</p>",

Enroll to learn more, complete the course and claim your badge!</em></p>\n<p>This course provides students with the fundamental knowledge required to use Excel spreadsheets to perform basic data analysis.The course consists of several videos, demos, examples, and hands-on labs to help you learn, and ends with a final assignment project which will help you put what you have learned into practice.</p>\n<p>Excel is an important tool when working with data - whether it is for business, marketing, research, or data analysis purposes. This course is targeted at those people who have ambitions in Data Analytics or Data Scientist roles, as well as those who just have a need to use Excel to perform data analysis in their own company or environment.</p>\n<p>Learners will gain useful experience in the cleaning and wrangling of data using functions, and in analyzing data using methods such as sorting, filtering, and pivot tables. This course starts with an introduction to spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets and discusses importing data from multiple different formats. During this introduction you will learn to carry out some basic-level data wrangling and data cleaning tasks and then you will expand your knowledge of data analysis via the use of sorting, filtering, and pivot tables in a spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>The emphasis is on applied learning and hands-on practice in this course, and with each hands-on lab, you will gain further experience in the manipulation and handling of data and start to understand the important role that spreadsheets can perform in a data analysis environment. The final assignment project will allow you to apply these newly acquired skills to analyze data in a business scenario. By the end of this course, you will have worked with several data sets and spreadsheets and demonstrated the basics of cleaning and analyzing data all without having to learn any code.</p>\n<p>This course makes it simple to get started using Excel for data analysis, as it does not require any previous spreadsheet or code-writing experience. The course also does not require you to perform any software downloads or installations. All that is required is a device with a modern web browser, and the ability to use (or create) a Microsoft account to access Excel online at no-cost. Although the hands-on labs steps are specifically related to using ‘Excel for the web’, if you already have the full desktop version of Excel, you should be able to use that to follow along quite easily with the labs.</p>",

Concepts like Agile, DevOps, and Data Science were once considered only for the technology-based companies. Today that means every company. Because there is no greater currency than timely information for optimizing operations and meeting the needs of customers.</p>\n<p>Modern product management requires that every development and operations value stream is identified and continuously improved. This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.</p>\n<p>Agile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point. The evolutionary nature of the product with so much change enables functionality, design, and technology to drive and influence each other simultaneously. And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.</p>\n<p>Data science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls. This means all data is fair game, and when tagged and stored properly, can be made available at nearly any scale for preparation, visualization, analysis, and modeling.</p>\n<p>We’ll teach you the paradigms, processes, and introduce some key technologies that make the data-driven product organization the optimal competitor in the market.</p>",

Concepts like Agile, DevOps, and Data Science were once considered only for the technology-based companies. Today that means every company. Because there is no greater currency than timely information for optimizing operations and meeting the needs of customers.</p>\n<p>Modern product management requires that every development and operations value stream is identified and continuously improved. This means using Lean and DevOps principles to streamline handoffs and information flows across teams. It means reorienting towards self-service and automation wherever possible. And to avoid incrementalism, it means a robust Agile development process to keep innovations important and aggressive enough to make noticeable improvements in value delivery.</p>\n<p>Agile systems in a DevOps environment requires that products are built completely differently from a traditional designs. Modularity, open set architectures, and flexible data management paradigms are a starting point. The evolutionary nature of the product with so much change enables functionality, design, and technology to drive and influence each other simultaneously. And beneath it all is a data collection and feedback loop essential for anticipating and reacting to business needs both for operations and marketing.</p>\n<p>Data science and analytics are the lifeblood of any product organization, and enable product managers to tackle risks early. Luckily, new technologies allow us to collect and integrate data without extreme upfront constraints and onerous controls. This means all data is fair game, and when tagged and stored properly, can be made available at nearly any scale for preparation, visualization, analysis, and modeling.</p>\n<p>We’ll teach you the paradigms, processes, and introduce some key technologies that make the data-driven product organization the optimal competitor in the market.</p>",

We do this by defining the financial risks related to climate change and follow with the investment policies and risk management strategies that are taking shape. This course is also a starting point for risk and strategy managers anticipating the impacts from the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) asking firms to disclose the climate risks they face. In short, the course is a primer on how global capital markets are responding the world’s greatest environmental risk. </p>\n<p>Participants will be exposed to the latest thinking from senior leaders in financial services and multinational firms. The course is led by business school faculty and The Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College London; designed by investment practitioners for finance professionals and those aspiring to enter the field. </p>\n<p>Climate-KIC is supported by EIT, a body of the European Union.</p>",

Geared towards professionals working in financial markets, this course provides a solid introduction to the financial risks and opportunities arising from man-made climate change. </p>\n<p>Our aim is to help you answer a simple question: Does climate risk matter to investors? We do this by defining the financial risks related to climate change and follow with the investment policies and risk management strategies that are taking shape. This course is also a starting point for risk and strategy managers anticipating the impacts from the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) asking firms to disclose the climate risks they face. In short, the course is a primer on how global capital markets are responding the world’s greatest environmental risk. </p>\n<p>Participants will be exposed to the latest thinking from senior leaders in financial services and multinational firms. The course is led by business school faculty and The Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College London; designed by investment practitioners for finance professionals and those aspiring to enter the field. </p>\n<p>Climate-KIC is supported by EIT, a body of the European Union.</p>",
