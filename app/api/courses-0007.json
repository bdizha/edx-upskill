The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs by using linear regression. </p>\n<p>We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process. It is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use, and this course will teach you when to apply this technique.</p>",

The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs by using linear regression. </p>\n<p>We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process. It is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use, and this course will teach you when to apply this technique.</p>",

Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. You will need to know some basic stats for this course. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",

In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. You will need to know some basic stats for this course. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",

By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.</p>\n<p>This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.</p>\n<p>Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.</p>\n<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide. Here they take a central insight from that course—that our personal well-being is entwined with our social connections—and explain how to apply it to the modern workplace to create more productive, satisfying experiences at work.</p>",

By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.</p>\n<p>This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.</p>\n<p>Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.</p>\n<p>What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.</p>\n<p>The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide. Here they take a central insight from that course—that our personal well-being is entwined with our social connections—and explain how to apply it to the modern workplace to create more productive, satisfying experiences at work.</p>",

Developed in partnership between W3C and <a href=\"http://univ-cotedazur.fr/en\">University Côte d'Azur</a>, this introductory course has been designed to help Web developers have an understanding of the basic concepts of the language. We present JavaScript best practices by means of many interactive examples, some of which being demonstrated in live coding videos.</p>\n<p>We use JavaScript in the Web browser. Why JavaScript is worth your time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5, CSS and JavaScript are the “classic three” for developers and designers;</li>\n<li>It adds interactivity to your Web sites;</li>\n<li>It is powerful, easy to learn, and quick to write;</li>\n<li>It has great tools (editors, runtimes, lint tools, browsers, and third party libraries) as well as great online support through plenty of active open source communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the course, we expect you to be able to read the source code of any JavaScript example found on the Web, learn from it, tweak it, and even – why not? – start contributing to open-source JavaScript projects.</p>",

No one wants to do research that can’t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any data intensive research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists. </p>\n<p>To meet the needs of the scientific community, this course will examine the fundamentals of methods and tools for reproducible research. Led by experienced faculty from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, you will participate in six modules that will include several case studies that illustrate the significant impact of reproducible research methods on scientific discovery. </p>\n<p>This course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project. </p>\n<p>We’ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing. </p>\n<p>Consider this course a survey of best practices: we’d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it’ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues. We look forward to seeing you in this course and the research you do in the future!</p>",

No one wants to do research that can’t be reproduced. Thus, this course is really for anyone who is doing any data intensive research. While many of us come from a biomedical background, this course is for a broad audience of data scientists. </p>\n<p>To meet the needs of the scientific community, this course will examine the fundamentals of methods and tools for reproducible research. Led by experienced faculty from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, you will participate in six modules that will include several case studies that illustrate the significant impact of reproducible research methods on scientific discovery. </p>\n<p>This course will appeal to students and professionals in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and data science. The course content will blend video lectures, case studies, peer-to-peer engagements and use of computational tools and platforms (such as R/RStudio, and Git/Github), culminating in a final presentation of a final reproducible research project. </p>\n<p>We’ll cover Fundamentals of Reproducible Science; Case Studies; Data Provenance; Statistical Methods for Reproducible Science; Computational Tools for Reproducible Science; and Reproducible Reporting Science. These concepts are intended to translate to fields throughout the data sciences: physical and life sciences, applied mathematics and statistics, and computing. </p>\n<p>Consider this course a survey of best practices: we’d like to make you aware of pitfalls in reproducible data science, some failure - and success - stories in the past, and tools and design patterns that might help make it all easier. But ultimately it’ll be up to you to take the skills you learn from this course to create your own environment in which you can easily carry out reproducible research, and to encourage and integrate with similar environments for your collaborators and colleagues. We look forward to seeing you in this course and the research you do in the future!</p>",
