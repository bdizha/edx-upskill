We’ll discuss fiscal, monetary, welfare and income policy—what they are, what tools they involve, and what political divisions they create. We’ll examine partisan divisions over regulatory policy, and the basis for those divisions. Finally, we’ll trace the evolution of America’s position as a trading nation by examining trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). </p>\n<p>This course will also serve as an overview of American government, concentrating on overarching tendencies such as its fragmented power structure.

Rarely are all these wrangling steps necessary in a single analysis, but a data scientist will likely face them all at some point. </p>\n<p>Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling. </p>\n<p>This process is a critical step for any data scientist.

Rarely are all these wrangling steps necessary in a single analysis, but a data scientist will likely face them all at some point. </p>\n<p>Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling. </p>\n<p>This process is a critical step for any data scientist. Knowing how to wrangle and clean data will enable you to make critical insights that would otherwise be hidden.</p>",

Around 70% of all opioid overdose deaths involved a prescription opioid. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States — opioid addiction is driving this epidemic. </p>\n<p>In this course, you'll learn about the origins and spread of this epidemic. Our experts will cover the appropriate ways this class of drugs should be used, but we will also explore the impact of opioid misuse on the individual, family, and community. You’ll hear about effective medical treatments for addiction and how to reduce the stigma that exists around addiction. You’ll learn how to help prevent overdose deaths and explore the multiple pathways to recovery. </p>\n<p>Join us to confront this epidemic with a broad perspective of the causes, effects, and solutions to the opioid crisis. After learning about harm-reduction approaches and evidence-based interventions to prevent addiction and support recovery, you will be equipped to confront the opioid epidemic. </p>\n<p>— </p>\n<p>This course is available for Continuing Education credit.

Around 70% of all opioid overdose deaths involved a prescription opioid. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States — opioid addiction is driving this epidemic. </p>\n<p>In this course, you'll learn about the origins and spread of this epidemic. Our experts will cover the appropriate ways this class of drugs should be used, but we will also explore the impact of opioid misuse on the individual, family, and community. You’ll hear about effective medical treatments for addiction and how to reduce the stigma that exists around addiction. You’ll learn how to help prevent overdose deaths and explore the multiple pathways to recovery. </p>\n<p>Join us to confront this epidemic with a broad perspective of the causes, effects, and solutions to the opioid crisis. After learning about harm-reduction approaches and evidence-based interventions to prevent addiction and support recovery, you will be equipped to confront the opioid epidemic. </p>\n<p>— </p>\n<p>This course is available for Continuing Education credit.
