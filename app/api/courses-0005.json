SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful programming language that is used for communicating with and manipulating data in databases. A working knowledge of databases and SQL is necessary for anyone who wants to start a career in Data Engineering, Data Analytics or Data Science. The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database (RDBMS) concepts and help you learn and apply foundational and intermediate knowledge of the SQL language.</span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span></p>\n<p>You will start with performing basic Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations using CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. You will then learn to filter, order, sort, and aggregate data. You will also work with functions, perform sub-selects and nested queries, as well as access multiple tables in the database.<span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span></p>\n<p>The emphasis in this course is on hands-on, practical learning. As such, you will work with real database systems, use real tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs, you will practice building and running SQL queries. At the end of the course you will apply and demonstrate your skills with a final project.<span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span></p>\n<p>The SQL skills you learn in this course will be applicable to a variety of RDBMSes such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2, Oracle, SQL Server and others.<span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span></p>\n<p>No prior knowledge of databases, SQL or programming is required, however some basic data literacy is beneficial.</p>",

This incident was, tragically, not unusual in London or the rest of the 19th century world as a whole. The scourge of cholera seemed unstoppable and, even worse, unpredictable. But one doctor -- ignored by the scientific community at large -- set out to prove that he knew how this infectious disease was spread.</p>\n<p>Join us for this one-week, immersive learning experience. We will explore John Snow’s London, from the streets of Soho to the dataset that helped create the map that changed our understanding of cholera, public health, and epidemiology forever.</p>\n<p>This course features interactive tools including an interactive ArcGIS map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak and a Timeline JS of John Snow’s investigation.</p>\n<p>This module is a part of PredictionX, which looks at the history of attempts to predict the future. PredictionX courses will cover topics from omens and oracles in ancient civilizations to modern computer simulations.</p>",

But one doctor -- ignored by the scientific community at large -- set out to prove that he knew how this infectious disease was spread.</p>\n<p>Join us for this one-week, immersive learning experience. We will explore John Snow’s London, from the streets of Soho to the dataset that helped create the map that changed our understanding of cholera, public health, and epidemiology forever.</p>\n<p>This course features interactive tools including an interactive ArcGIS map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak and a Timeline JS of John Snow’s investigation.</p>\n<p>This module is a part of PredictionX, which looks at the history of attempts to predict the future.

The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. After completing this specialization, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists.</p>\n<p>Specific topics in the course include: \"Big-oh\" notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts), data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of BFS and DFS, connectivity, shortest paths).</p>\n<p>Learners will practice and master the fundamentals of algorithms through several types of assessments. There are 6 multiple choice quizzes to test your understanding of the most important concepts. There are also 6 programming assignments, where you implement one of the algorithms covered in lecture in a programming language of your choosing. The course concludes with a multiple-choice final. There are no assignment due dates and you can work through the course materials and assignments at your own pace.</p>",

The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. After completing this specialization, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists.</p>\n<p>Specific topics in the course include: \"Big-oh\" notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts), data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of BFS and DFS, connectivity, shortest paths).</p>\n<p>Learners will practice and master the fundamentals of algorithms through several types of assessments. There are 6 multiple choice quizzes to test your understanding of the most important concepts. There are also 6 programming assignments, where you implement one of the algorithms covered in lecture in a programming language of your choosing. The course concludes with a multiple-choice final. There are no assignment due dates and you can work through the course materials and assignments at your own pace.</p>",

TinyML differs from mainstream machine learning (e.g., server and cloud) in that it requires not only software expertise, but also embedded-hardware expertise.</p>\n<p>The first course in the TinyML Certificate series, Fundamentals of TinyML will focus on the basics of machine learning, deep learning, and embedded devices and systems, such as smartphones and other tiny devices. Throughout the course, you will learn data science techniques for collecting data and develop an understanding of learning algorithms to train basic machine learning models. At the end of this course, you will be able to understand the “language” behind TinyML and be ready to dive into the application of TinyML in future courses.</p>\n<p>Following Fundamentals of TinyML, the other courses in the TinyML Professional Certificate program will allow you to see the code behind widely-used Tiny ML applications—such as tiny devices and smartphones—and deploy code to your own physical TinyML device. Fundamentals of TinyML provides an introduction to TinyML and is not a prerequisite for Applications of TinyML or Deploying TinyML for those with sufficient machine learning and embedded systems experience.</p>",

However, the ability to predict when and where one will reach a distant destination is more than just a key to empire-building — it’s often a matter of life and death. </p>\n<p>Using video, text, infographics, and Worldwide Telescope tours, we will explore the tools and techniques that navigators have used, with a particular focus on the importance (and difficulty) of measuring longitude. Grounded in the principles of position, direction, speed, and time, we will learn the challenges of navigating without a GPS signal. We’ll learn how the Age of Exploration and the economic forces of worldwide trade encouraged scientific progress in navigation; and how Jupiter’s moons, lunar eclipses, and clockmakers all played a part in orienting history’s navigators. </p>\n<p>Centuries of progress in navigation have helped put humans on the moon and spacecraft on a comet. This course will explain how we got there, and how that progress enables you to get where you’re going today.</p>",

As we developed the tools and techniques for determining location and planning a route, navigation grew into a practice, an art, and a science. Navigational skill has long been tied to commercial, economic, and military success. However, the ability to predict when and where one will reach a distant destination is more than just a key to empire-building — it’s often a matter of life and death. </p>\n<p>Using video, text, infographics, and Worldwide Telescope tours, we will explore the tools and techniques that navigators have used, with a particular focus on the importance (and difficulty) of measuring longitude. Grounded in the principles of position, direction, speed, and time, we will learn the challenges of navigating without a GPS signal. We’ll learn how the Age of Exploration and the economic forces of worldwide trade encouraged scientific progress in navigation; and how Jupiter’s moons, lunar eclipses, and clockmakers all played a part in orienting history’s navigators. </p>\n<p>Centuries of progress in navigation have helped put humans on the moon and spacecraft on a comet. This course will explain how we got there, and how that progress enables you to get where you’re going today.</p>",

You will be introduced to the version control systems git, a powerful tool for keeping track of changes in your scripts and reports. We also introduce you to GitHub and demonstrate how you can use this service to keep your work in a repository that facilitates collaborations. </p>\n<p>Finally, you will learn to write reports in R markdown which permits you to incorporate text and code into a document. We'll put it all together using the powerful integrated desktop environment RStudio.</p>",

Join us to better understand how to apply frameworks and tools to make smart financial choices.</p>\n<p>You will be able to value the impact of different choices available to you: from renting or buying, evaluating car, home and student loans, or deciding whether to go to college versus pursuing a new idea to simply understanding how the financial world works.</p>\n<p>Starting with time value of money, the course will help you develop a full appreciation for the many applications of finance. Using real world examples, the course will enable you to understand and analyze many personal and professional decisions we confront on a daily basis. You will understand stocks and bonds, learn to allocate scarce resources in a value-add way, and adopt smart tools for making every day decisions.</p>\n<p>Finance is simultaneously a way of thinking and a set of tools. Finance is everywhere. There are no prerequisites for this course except for a sense of curiosity and a positive attitude. However, a comfort level with algebra and numbers and an understanding of accounting (the language of business) will clearly help. We will, however, try to cover everything starting with fundamentals and highlight when there is a need to do some further work in specific subjects.</p>",
