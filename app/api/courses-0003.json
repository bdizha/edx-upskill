It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>\n<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>\n<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>\n<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",

It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. </p>\n<p><em>Relational Databases and SQL</em> is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.</p>\n<p>All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Learn About Databases</strong></p>\n<p>Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.</p>",

Perspective drawing and architectural typology are explored and you will be introduced to some of the challenges in writing architectural history.</p>\n<p>Then we address technology as a component of architecture. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. Technological advances changed what could be built, and even what could even be thought of as architecture.</p>\n<p>Finally, we'll confront architecture’s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. You will learn about architecture’s power of representation and see how it can produce collective meaning and memory.</p>\n<p>Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society.

This course will teach you how to understand architecture as both cultural expression and technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings, and hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, will bring you closer to the work of architects and historians.</p>\n<p>The first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination. Perspective drawing and architectural typology are explored and you will be introduced to some of the challenges in writing architectural history.</p>\n<p>Then we address technology as a component of architecture. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. Technological advances changed what could be built, and even what could even be thought of as architecture.</p>\n<p>Finally, we'll confront architecture’s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. You will learn about architecture’s power of representation and see how it can produce collective meaning and memory.</p>\n<p>Architecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Join us as we examine how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture’s complex aspirations.</p>\n<p>This course is eligible for American Institute of Architects (AIA) continuing education units (CEUs).

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction of high-dimensional data sets, and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the <em>batch effect,</em> the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today, and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.</p>\n<p>Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput, large-scale data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction of high-dimensional data sets, and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the <em>batch effect,</em> the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today, and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.</p>\n<p>Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput, large-scale data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",
