Conveying a convincing message can benefit your personal, public, and professional lives.</p>\n<p>This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of rhetoric, the art of persuasive writing and speech. In it, you will learn to construct and defend compelling arguments, a crucial skill in many settings. We will be using selected speeches from prominent twentieth-century Americans -- including Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, Margaret Chase Smith, Ronald Reagan, and more -- to explore and analyze rhetorical structure and style. Through this analysis, you will learn how speakers and writers persuade an audience to adopt their point of view.</p>\n<p>Built around Harvard Professor James Engell's on-campus course, \"Elements of Rhetoric,\" this course will help you analyze and apply rhetorical structure and style, appreciate the relevance of persuasive communication in your own life, and understand how to persuade and recognize when someone is trying to persuade you. You will be inspired to share your viewpoint and discover the most powerful ways to convince others to champion your cause. Join us to find your voice!</p>",

You can better retain R when you learn it to solve a specific problem, so you'll use a real-world dataset about crime in the United States. You will learn the R skills needed to answer essential questions about differences in crime across the different states. </p>\n<p>We'll cover R's functions and data types, then tackle how to operate on vectors and when to use advanced functions like sorting. You'll learn how to apply general programming features like \"if-else,\" and \"for loop\" commands, and how to wrangle, analyze and visualize data. </p>\n<p>Rather than covering every R skill you might need, you'll build a strong foundation to prepare you for the more in-depth courses later in the series, where we cover concepts like probability, inference, regression, and machine learning. We help you develop a skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with dplyr, data visualization with ggplot2, file organization with UNIX/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio. </p>\n<p>The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing, and this series prepares you to tackle real-world data analysis challenges.</p>",

You can better retain R when you learn it to solve a specific problem, so you'll use a real-world dataset about crime in the United States. You will learn the R skills needed to answer essential questions about differences in crime across the different states. </p>\n<p>We'll cover R's functions and data types, then tackle how to operate on vectors and when to use advanced functions like sorting. You'll learn how to apply general programming features like \"if-else,\" and \"for loop\" commands, and how to wrangle, analyze and visualize data. </p>\n<p>Rather than covering every R skill you might need, you'll build a strong foundation to prepare you for the more in-depth courses later in the series, where we cover concepts like probability, inference, regression, and machine learning. We help you develop a skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with dplyr, data visualization with ggplot2, file organization with UNIX/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio. </p>\n<p>The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing, and this series prepares you to tackle real-world data analysis challenges.</p>",

How do data scientists use this data for the applications that power our modern world?</p>\n<p>Data science is an ever-evolving field, using algorithms and scientific methods to parse complex data sets. Data scientists use a range of programming languages, such as Python and R, to harness and analyze data. This course focuses on using Python in data science. By the end of the course, you’ll have a fundamental understanding of machine learning models and basic concepts around Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>\n<p>Using Python, learners will study regression models (Linear, Multilinear, and Polynomial) and classification models (kNN, Logistic), utilizing popular libraries such as sklearn, Pandas, matplotlib, and numPy. The course will cover key concepts of machine learning such as: picking the right complexity, preventing overfitting, regularization, assessing uncertainty, weighing trade-offs, and model evaluation. Participation in this course will build your confidence in using Python, preparing you for more advanced study in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and advancement in your career.</p>\n<p>Learners must have a minimum baseline of programming knowledge (preferably in Python) and statistics in order to be successful in this course. Python prerequisites can be met with an introductory Python course offered through CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python, and statistics prerequisites can be met via Fat Chance or with Stat110 offered through HarvardX.</p>",

Used at the start of Harvard College's introductory course in computer science, CS50, Scratch was designed at MIT's Media Lab, empowering students with no prior programming experience to design their own animations, games, interactive art, and stories. Using Scratch, this course introduces students to fundamentals of programming, found not only in Scratch itself but in traditional text-based languages (like Java and Python) as well. Topics include: functions, which are instructions that perform tasks; return values, which are results that functions provide; conditions, via which programs can decide whether or not to perform some action; loops, via which programs can take action again and again; variables, via which programs can remember information; and more. Ultimately, this course prepares students for subsequent courses in programming.</p>\n<p>Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.

Used at the start of Harvard College's introductory course in computer science, CS50, Scratch was designed at MIT's Media Lab, empowering students with no prior programming experience to design their own animations, games, interactive art, and stories. Using Scratch, this course introduces students to fundamentals of programming, found not only in Scratch itself but in traditional text-based languages (like Java and Python) as well. Topics include: functions, which are instructions that perform tasks; return values, which are results that functions provide; conditions, via which programs can decide whether or not to perform some action; loops, via which programs can take action again and again; variables, via which programs can remember information; and more. Ultimately, this course prepares students for subsequent courses in programming.</p>\n<p>Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.

In this online course you will learn foundational Microsoft Excel (also applicable to Google Sheets) knowledge including spreadsheet and workbook anatomy, data entry, summary, and manipulation, plotting and visualization, and powerful tools such as functions, conditional formatting, vlookup, mathematical formulas, graphs, macros, keyboard shortcuts, cell references, filters, sorts, and pivot tables.</p>\n<p>Not only will this Excel tutorial provide you with a step-by-step training to obtain strong skills in Excel basics, but you will also find several pathways to continue learning the skills you need after the course. Basic Excel skills are required for many jobs, but more advanced skills are often learned on the job. This course can help you quickly get to the point of being able to learn more advanced skills on your own or on the job.</p>\n<p>The approach of this course will be different from a typical software course. Rather than focusing on moving through as many tools and skills as quickly as possible, this course will emphasize gaining comfort and familiarity with some of the most useful and foundational skills, the skills that will be key to your success in using Excel now and in the future. You will have the opportunity to practice these skills and identify general principles of successfully working with spreadsheets to be more efficient, reliable, and effective in your work.</p>",

We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding and ability to implement basic data analyses. We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of conducting reproducible research.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the course materials into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. We start with simple calculations and descriptive statistics. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",

We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding and ability to implement basic data analyses. We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of conducting reproducible research.</p>\n<p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the course materials into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. We start with simple calculations and descriptive statistics. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.</p>\n<p>These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:</p>\n<p><strong>Data Analysis for Life Sciences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r\">PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra\">PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-inference-and-modeling-for-high-throug\">PH525.3x: Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/high-dimensional-data-analysis\">PH525.4x: High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genomics Data Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-and-analys\">PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/case-studies-in-functional-genomics\">PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-bioconductor\">PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.</p>",
